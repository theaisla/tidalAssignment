This is my solution for the Tital website assignment.
Being completely new to angularjs and sass, I spent some time getting used to these ways of working, particularly getting a grasp of angularjs has taken time.

My solution consists of a responsive design for web, tablet and smartphones. All of the animations work on all platforms (although has not been tested on android phones other than in the developer tools in chrome.)

I have created a functioning dropdown menu with angularjs and CSS transitions.
I have created a functioning slide for the first section, which also works when the user swipes. I have also used css transitions here.
I chose to switch the slides using different opacity values instead of a traditional slide transition because in my personal experience it is easier on the eye, and I thought the overall look fit better with this solution.
In addition to this I added a parallax effect to some of the elements to create a slightly more exciting experience.


If I had more time I would have liked to implement a menu that is hidden and shown with angularjs when scrolling. For now the opacity changes with a short javascript code to partly visualize what I had in mind.
I would also have spent some more time working on the responsive displays as they are not all exactly as I want them, and tried perfecting the placements a little more in order to make the site resemble the photoshop files as closely as possible.


Working functions to test:
Dropdown menu that is responsive.
Three slide elements that work either by swiping or by pressing the buttons located the the bottom of the initial window. Slides both forwars and backwards. Slides are responsive.
Parallax effect when scrolling.
Main navigation changes opacity when scrolling up and down.
All "links" change visually when mouse hovers on element (social media icons, two buttons and navigation list elements).
